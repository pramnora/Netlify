## Why sign up for the FREE Netlify service?

GitHub is a great service...in that it allows one to store lots of code.  

The only problem is that you cannot always see that code being displayed in actual 'action';     
but, instead, all you see is just merely 'static' source code text, alone.  

That's why I decided to go sign up for a FREE online a/c. at: Netlify;   
you can both 'sign up/sign in' using your same GitHub credentials.  

Basically, once you've already gone and created a Netlify a/c.; (and, are also a member of GitHub);  
1. then, you simply sign in to Netlify...  
2. select your GitHub folder     
3. and, Netlify automatically produce an internet 'link' you can click on to see your web pages in action 'live'.
