## Why I chose to go sign up for the FREE online Netlify service?

GitHub, is a truly 'great' service; especially, when it comes to storing lots and lots of 'source code'.  

However, most of the time, I wish to see that source code being displayed in actual 'action';  
which GitHub doesn't allow me to do; and, this is where using  
a FREE online web site hosting service such as, Netlify, comes in.  

You can use a mixture of both: GitHub/Netlify...to both host source code/display web pages;      
in fact, you can actually 'sign up/sign in' to Netlify by using your same GitHub credentials.  

Basically, once you've already gone and created a Netlify a/c...      
1. First, create inside of the GitHub folder directory you wish to link to an [index.html] file/together with links to each file you wish to see displayed.
2. Next, sign in to Netlify (use GitHub credentials to sign in if you wish).     
3. From inside of Netlify, select the GitHub folder (where you have your web page files source code).  
4. The Netlify service will next produce an internet 'link'...         
   that displays your GitHub [index.html] file together with its links.  

Some examples are:-

Netlify, also, has many other services including 'paid for'...such as, buying Domain Name/SSL/-etc.;        
however, I decided just to sign up for the FREE a/c., instead.
