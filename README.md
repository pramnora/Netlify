## Why use GitHub/Netlify?

- GitHub, is used to store 'source code'  
- Netlify, is used to deploy web sites/(so, you can witness seeing the source code in actual action, ie. view the web page 'output')  

Of course, you will need to sign up with both services in order to use them either alone/or else, in conjunction together.

## How to use Netlify on it's own?

After you've gone and signed up for a Netlify online a/c.; and, are already signed into the a/c. 

You simply 'drag and drop' a folder onto the Netlify user interface;   
and, your site/web page/s are, automatically, deployed (this process, usually, takes just merely seconds);    
you are, then, given a FREE URL address to go and view it.  

*NOTE:* It's possible to change the name of the URL address by going into: [Settings] > Change name.  

## How to use Netlify in conjunction with GitHub?

1. First, create inside of the GitHub folder directory you wish to link to an [index.html] file/together with links to each file you wish to see displayed.
2. Next, sign in to Netlify (use GitHub credentials to sign in if you wish).     
3. From inside of Netlify, select the GitHub folder (where you have your web page files source code).  
4. The Netlify service will next produce an internet 'link'...         
   that displays your GitHub [index.html] file together with its links.  

Some examples are:-  

-> http://paulramnora.netlify.com  (my main Netlify web site/currently stored on my computer desktop; but, not on Github itself)    
-> https://security-administrator-sheep-16127.netlify.com  (simple 3 page web site)  
-> https://wonderful-booth-2739ea.netlify.com (vue-js codes)    
-> https://modest-volhard-214034.netlify.com/ (css codes)  
   
Netlify, also, has many other services including 'paid for'...such as, buying Domain Name/SSL/-etc.;        
however, I decided just to sign up for the FREE a/c., instead.
