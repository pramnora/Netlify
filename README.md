## Why I chose to go sign up for the FREE online Netlify service?

GitHub, is a truly 'great' service; especially, when it comes to storing lots and lots of 'source code'.  

However, most of the time, I wish to see that source code being displayed in actual 'action';  
which GitHub doesn't allow me to do; and, this is where using  
a FREE online web site hosting service such as, Netlify, comes in.  

You can use a mixture of both: GitHub/Netlify...to both host source code/display web pages;      
in fact, you can actually 'sign up/sign in' to Netlify by using your same GitHub credentials.  

Basically, once you've already gone and created a Netlify a/c.; (and, are also a member of GitHub);  
1. then, you simply sign in to Netlify (use GitHub credentials to sign in if you wish)     
2. select the GitHub folder (where you have your web page files source code)             
3. and, the Netlify service will, automatically, produce an internet 'link'...   
   that you can click on to see your GitHub based web pages in action 'live'.  
   
Netlify, also, has many other services including 'paid for'...such as, buying Domain Name/SSL/-etc.;        
however, I decided just to sign up for the FREE a/c., instead.
